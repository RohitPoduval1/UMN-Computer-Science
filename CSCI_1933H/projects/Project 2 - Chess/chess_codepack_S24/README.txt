-How to compile and run my program
    1. Make sure that you have all the required files on your system (ideally in a designated folder)
        -Bishop.java
        -Board.java
        -Fen.java (not specific to my program since it was provided with the lab)
        -Game.java
        -King.java
        -Knight.java
        -Pawn.java (not specific to my program since it was provided with the lab)
        -Piece.java
        -Queen.java
        -Rook.java
    2. Using the terminal, navigate to the location of the folder where the files are located
    3. run "javac Game.java", you should now have a .class for each of the .java files in the same folder
    4. run "java Game"
    5. Follow the prompts and play a game of chess!

-Assumptions: The files are located all in the same folder

-Known Bug: If using IntelliJ, dark mode will make the white pieces appear black and black pieces
appear white in the terminal. This is just a visual bug and will not affect gameplay

-Outside Sources: http://www.netreal.de/Forsyth-Edwards-Notation/index.php was used for debugging
and making FEN notations quickly for specific board set-ups
