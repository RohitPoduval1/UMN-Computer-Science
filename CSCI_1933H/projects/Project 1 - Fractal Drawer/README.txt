-How to compile and run my program
    1. Make sure that you have all the required files on your system (ideally in a designated folder)
        -Canvas.java (not specific to my program since it was provided with the lab)
        -Circle.java
        -Triangle.java
        -Rectangle.java
        -FractalDrawer.java
    2. Using the terminal, navigate to the location of the folder where the files are located
    3. run "javac FractalDrawer.java", you should now have a .class for each of the .java files in the same folder
    4. run "java FractalDrawer"
    5. Follow the prompt that appears and bask in the beauty of the fractal you drew!
    (Important Note: be sure to enter fullscreen for seeing the entire shape, otherwise it may appear as if it is cut off)

-Assumptions: The files are located all in the same folder

-Additional Feature: the user is prompted for an input of "triangle", "circle", or "rectangle" until they enter the proper input 

-Known Bug: In general, if the specified level of recursion exceeds 9, there may be issues with the canvas drawing the complete fractal.

-Outside Sources: coolors.co and Pinterest were referenced in determining appealing color palettes for each shape
