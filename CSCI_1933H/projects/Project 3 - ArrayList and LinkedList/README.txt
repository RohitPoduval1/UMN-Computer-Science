• Worked alone

• How to compile and run your program
1. Make sure that you have all the required files on your system (ideally in a designated folder)
    -ArrayList.java 
    -LinkedList.java
    -ArrayListTest.java  (not specific to my program since it was provided with the lab)
    -LinkedListTest.java (not specific to my program since it was provided with the lab)
2. Open an IDE like IntelliJ or VSCode and set up the environment to run the tests
3. Run ArrayListTest.java and/or LinkedListTest.java OR use the ArrayList or LinkedList to store elements

• Assumptions: You have an IDE that is able to run tests if you choose to run the tests

• Additional Features: Some additional helper methods
(that are denoted by a comment in the code saying "Custom method")

• Any known bugs or defects in the program: None

• Any outside sources (aside from course resources) consulted for ideas: None
