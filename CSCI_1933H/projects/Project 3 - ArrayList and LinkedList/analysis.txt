• add(T element)
    -ArrayList Runtime:
        The runtime is O(n) where n is the number of non-null elements in the list (or list.size)
        because resizing is linearly dependent on the size of the array since elements need to be copied over to the new array.
    -LinkedList Runtime:
        The runtime is O(n) where n is the number of non-null elements in the list (or list.size) because you must traverse
        the entire length of the list to get to the last node and have it point to the new element.

• getMax() 
    -ArrayList Runtime:
        If the list is sorted, the runtime is O(1) since the largest element will be at the end, which can 
        be indexed directly. If the list is not sorted, the runtime is O(n) where n is the number of non-null elements in the list
        (or list.size) since the all elements in the list will need to be iterated through and compared with a variable to get the
        largest element. 
    -LinkedList Runtime:
        The runtime is O(n) since in a linked list, you cannot index items directly. To get to the last item if the list is sorted, 
        we must traverse the entire list. If the list is not sorted, the entire list must be traversed to make comparisons with a
        variable to get the largest element.

• removeDuplicates()
    -ArrayList Runtime:
        O(n²) where n is the number of non-null elements in the list (or list.size) because there is a for loop that
        loops through the entire size of the list while calling add() (which is O(n)) inside the loop, which essentially acts as a nested
        for loop since both loops are going through the entire list. Essentially, add() is being called n times which is n². 
    -LinkedList Runtime:
        O(n²) where n is the number of non-null elements in the list (or list.size) because there is a while loop that
        loops through the entire list while calling add() (which is O(n)) inside the loop. 

• reverse()
    -ArrayList Runtime: 
        The runtime is O(n²) where n is the number of non-null elements in the list (or list.size) since the algorithm to
        reverse is based on bubble sort and implements a for loop nested in a for loop, both of which iterate over the
        entire size of the list. 
    -LinkedList Runtime:
        The runtime is O(n) where n is the number of non-null elements in the list (or list.size) since there is only one
        while loop that traverses the size of list and swapping elements (which is just reassignment of variables) is a
        constant operation.
